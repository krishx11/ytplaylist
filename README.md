#YouTube Playlist Genereator

The YouTube Playlist Generator is a web application that allows users to create custom playlists based on specific themes, keywords, or user preferences. This project leverages the YouTube Data API to search for videos matching the userâ€™s criteria and compiles them into a cohesive playlist.
